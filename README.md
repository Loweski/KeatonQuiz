# KeatonQuiz
This application is based on the Keaton Minigame from LOZ: Majora's Mask.

The gist of the Minigame is that you will be ask a few questions regarding information about the game itself. If you answer all correctly,
you get a reward. Failing one question, ends the minigame. For this application, the changes I'm making is that there will be more
questions but will have questions about other LOZ games as well.

The End Goal:
-The user would be approached by the web with a question of whether or not they want to proceed with the minigame.
-The Question will appear along with 4 choices
-Choose correctly and it will display correct with a button to proceed to the next question
-Cycle repeat until the user finish all the questions or fail for the first time.
-Both ending will show the results of the minigame
